##WindowsPhoneFan.dk app for Windows Phone

###What is WindowsPhoneFan.dk?
WindowsPhoneFan.dk is a danish community site with news, guides etc. relevant for danish Windows Phone users.

The site can be found here: [www.windowsphonefan.dk](http://www.windowsphonefan.dk/), [www.wpfan.dk](http://www.wpfan.dk/) or [www.windowsfan.dk](http://www.windowsfan.dk/)

###The Project
The idea with this project is to let the community create and develop a Windows Phone app for accessing WindowsPhoneFan.dk.

Currently there is an app for accessing the site, but it's not optimal, especially when handling danish characters like æ, ø and å.
The current version is based on this [Starter Kit](https://github.com/ChrisKoenig/Windows-Phone-Starter-Kit-for-WordPress).

I think it would be very cool and fun to try and work together with some of you guys on this app, which is the main reason I created this project.
Even people who are not active in the development of this app could learn something from following along.

###Language - english?
WindowsPhoneFan.dk is a danish site, written in danish, so why are all the text here on Github in english? Well, when I code I like things to be in english, both readme's like this, but also variables in code, bug reports, issues etc. 
It just makes everything easier in the long run to have a common language when you code. At least that's what I think. So everything will be in english, except the actual language inside the app of cause - it will be in danish :)
