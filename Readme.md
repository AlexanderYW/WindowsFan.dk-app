**What is WindowsPhoneFan.dk?**

WindowsPhoneFan.dk is a danish community site with news, guides etc. relevant for danish Windows Phone users.

The site can be found here: [www.windowsphonefan.dk](http://www.windowsphonefan.dk/)

**The Project**

The idea with this project is to let the community create and develop a Windows Phone app for accessing WindowsPhoneFan.dk.

Currently there is an app for accessing the site, but it's not optimal, especially when handling danish characters like æ, ø and å.
The current version is based on this [Starter Kit](https://github.com/ChrisKoenig/Windows-Phone-Starter-Kit-for-WordPress).

I think it would be very cool and fun to try and work together with some of you guys on this app, which is the main reason I created this project.
Even people who are not active in the development of this app could learn something from following along.

**Language**

WindowsPhoneFan.dk is a danish site, written in danish, so why are all this text in english? Well, when I code I like things to be in english, both readme's like this, but also variables in code, bug reports, issues etc. 
It just makes everything easier in the long run to have a common language when you code. At least that's what I think. So everything will be in english, except the actual language inside the app of cause - it will be in danish :)

More stuff will be added to this readme telling about how we are going to do this. Right now I'm just setting the stage and putting up the base project that we will work from.

Stay tuned :)
